A demo app for Android is provided that will load a model you add to the project and allow you to classify photos against it.

## Install Android Studio
The recommended way to develop applications for Android is by using Android Studio, which can be downloaded [here](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html)

## Open the project with Android Studio
Launch Android Studio and choose **Open an existing Android Studio project**

In the file selector, choose `cloud-annotations/app-android/tflite`.

You will get a **Gradle Sync** popup, the first time you open the project, asking about using gradle wrapper. Click **OK**.

## Set up an Android device
You can't load the app from android studio onto your phone unless you activate **developer mode** and **USB Debugging**. This is a one time setup process.

Follow these [instructions](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options.html#enable).

## Add your model files to the project
The demo app is configured to search for a `model.tflite` and a `model.labels` file in the `app-android/tflite/app/src/main/assets/` directory. The following command will move these files for you:

```
cp .tmp/model.tflite android/tflite/app/src/main/assets/model.tflite
cp .tmp/model.labels android/tflite/app/src/main/assets/model.labels
```

## Run the app
In Android Studio run a **Gradle sync** so the build system can find your files.

Then hit play to start the build and install process.
