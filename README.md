--------------------  
IMPORTANT NOTE:  
We've deprecated CloudAnnotations. For educational purposes we recommend to use [CVStudio](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=6XCy9m24kPE), which is based on CloudAnnotations  - it is available if you take one of our [courses](https://skills.network/lab-tools/cv-studio)
--------------------

## Before you begin

To train a model you should already have labeled images in the [Cloud Annotations online tool][0]. For an in-depth guide on this process, check out the following links:

- [Training a Classification Model][1] – How to train your own model to label images on IBM Cloud.
- [Training an Object Detection Model][2] – How to train your own model to find objects in an image on IBM Cloud.

If something doesn’t work, please [file an issue][issues].
