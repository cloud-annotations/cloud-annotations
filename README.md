## Installation

```bash
$ npm install -g cloud-annotations
```

## Before you begin

The Cloud Annotations CLI requires you to already have labeled images in the [Cloud Annotations online tool](https://cloud.annotations.ai/). For an in-depth guide on this process, check out the following links:

- [Training a Classification Model](https://cloud-annotations.github.io/training/classification/cli/) – How to train your own model to label images on IBM Cloud.
- [Training an Object Detection Model](https://cloud-annotations.github.io/training/object-detection/cli/) – How to train your own model to find objects in an image on IBM Cloud.

Cloud Annotations CLI should work on macOS, Windows, and Linux.<br>
If something doesn’t work, please [file an issue](https://github.com/cloud-annotations/training/issues/new).
